ActionNode _added_to_container() func added
- ActionContainer calls ActionNode _added_to_container()

ActionContainer checks for nested children

changes to Action node can_play so that play is only called if not playing

action container will call ActionNode._added_to_container() if action is to be added and already exists.
This allows for a refresh of the ActionNode when the action container changes configurations to one that the action
 node already exists in. on config change an action would not be removed it it was active and existed in the new config,
 potentially breaking references set in ActionNode._added_to_container()

with the addition of a global config state the responsibilites of action container config has grown
 and now holds the active profile as well as validation functions

action container only has one reconfigure func now

static_helper_functions rotate_y_to_point() has been changed to a better face_point()

logic change in action node for can_play
 allows layered actions to always be called if they are enabled
 still prevents non-layered actions from interrupting themselves 

action node now has enter and exit funcs as well as updated signals
 action container adjusted to use new node fucntions

added movement state velocity tag tracking
